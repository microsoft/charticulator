    ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial
    ownership of such entity.

    "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions
    granted by this License.

    "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including but
    not limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.

    "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or
    translation of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code, generated
    documentation, and conversions to other media types.

    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made
    available under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or
    attached to the work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is
    based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations,
    elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of
    authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works
    that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the
    Work and Derivative Works thereof.

    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of
    the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that
    is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or
    by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner.
    For the purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal, or
    written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not
    limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and
    issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose
    of discussing and improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously
    marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom
    a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the
    Work.

    2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
    each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
    royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such
    Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

    3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each
    Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
    royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
    made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such
    license applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are
    necessarily infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
    Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in
    a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work
    constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted
    to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is
    filed.

    4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative
    Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form,
    provided that You meet the following conditions:

    You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this
    License; and

    You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed
    the files; and

    You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all
    copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
    excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

    If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any
    Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution
    notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to
    any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE
    text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
    documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated
    by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The
    contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the
    License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You
    distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that
    such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License. You may
    add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or
    different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your
    modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated
    in this License.

    5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
    Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor
    shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or
    conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms
    of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such
    Contributions.

    6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
    trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for
    reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the
    content of the NOTICE file.

    7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing,
    Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS"
    BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including,
    without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT,
    MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for
    determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
    associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

    8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort
    (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as
    deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or
    consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the
    use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of
    goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial
    damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such
    damages.

    9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or
    Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of
    support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with
    this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf
    and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You
    agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred
    by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such
    warranty or additional liability.
